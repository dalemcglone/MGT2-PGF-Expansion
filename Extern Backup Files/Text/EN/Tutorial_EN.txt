Hello and welcome to <b>Mad Games Tycoon 2</b>. I will explain the basics of the game. Let's start with how to move the camera. There are two ways:<br><br><color=blue>▪ Using the W,A,S,D keys<br>▪ Hold down the right mouse button and move the mouse</color>
You can also rotate and zoom the camera.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Use the Q and E keys to rotate the camera<br>▪ Hold down the middle mouse button and move the mouse<br>▪ Use the scroll wheel to zoom</color>
As you've probably noticed, you need to build a studio in your garage. To earn some extra money, you should first sell your old sports car.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on your old sports car</color>
To sell your car, you just need to click on the <b>'Sell Item'</b> button. With the <b>left mouse button</b> you can place objects.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on the 'Sell item' button</color>
Now we should start building your game studio. To build rooms, you need to click the <b>marked button</b> and select the room you want. You will notice many room types, some are unlocked through research while others are unlocked in due time.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on the marked button 'Build rooms' and select 'Development'</color>
To design a room, hold down the <b>left mouse button</b> while moving your mouse. Keep in mind that each room must have a door.<br><br><color=blue>▪ 1. Design the room<br>▪ 2. Place a door<br>▪ 3. Click 'Accept' to build the room</color>
Now you should buy some objects for your room. Every employee needs a workplace but you should also make the room comfortable inside and out. Place items for comfort (like radiators for heat) and ways to keep things tidy (trash cans inside rooms, and the cleaning robot found in the corridor option outside of rooms).<br><br><color=blue>▪ Place at least one workplace<br>▪ Click on 'Close'</color>
It’s important to know your employees have needs. You can mouse over an unhappy employee to find out what is making them unhappy. Unhappy employees work slower and tend to quit. Don’t forget to have an adequate amount of <b>lounges</b> and <b>bathrooms</b> for your employees so they can recharge!
Now we should assign your game character to the <b>Development room</b>. Every employee has a preferred room type they work best in, more on this shortly. To do this, click on your game character and drop them into the <b>Development room</b>. The character will automatically go to a desk and wait for a task for the room.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click your game character and drop him in the 'Development room'</color>
Now we can develop a game. To give a room a task, click on the <b>button above the room</b>. When you click a room icon, various options appear in the center and bottom of the menu. For example, You can always view what employees each room requires by clicking the little person icon at the bottom of the menu (employees assigned to this room).<br><br><color=blue>▪ 1. Click on the button of the Development room<br>▪ 2. Select 'Develop a Game'</color>
As you can see, some options are not available yet. Some unlock in later years, and others when you’ve completed certain accomplishments. To create a new game, click <b>'New PC and Console Game'</b>.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click the 'New PC and Console Game' button</color>
You have many different settings available for your games. Many settings have synergies between them, having idea matches that create higher scoring games. Experience in the settings with stars also has significant quality impact depending on your difficulty setting. Customize the game to your liking, and find out later what worked and what did not through Game Reports in the Quality Assurance room. Click on the <b>green check mark</b> when you are done.<br><br><color=blue>▪ 1. Design the game according to your wishes<br>▪ 2. Click on 'Start development'</color>
So far so good! To adjust the game speed, or to pause the game, you can click on the <b>marked buttons</b>. Now click on the <b>fastest game speed</b> to make your character start working.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Set the fastest game speed</color>
You can now see your game character working on your game. Once the game is completed, a menu will appear to publish the game.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Wait until your game is finished</color>
In the beginning you can only publish your games through a publisher. Later in the game, you will have the opportunity to research the ability to publish your own games. Additionally, if you build up a maximum reputation with a publisher, they can offer you an exclusive contract (found under ‘Management’ button on the bottom bar).<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on 'Search Publisher' and select a publisher</color>
Once you publish a game, you get experience. For example, increasing experience can decrease development costs or improve the gameplay of your game.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on 'Accept'</color>
The sales of your games is not only related to the quality of your games. An oversaturated market, a trend or an unpopular console can affect the numbers.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on 'Accept'</color>
Your game has received an age rating from 'Mad Games Software Rating', and is now on the desk of all the gaming magazines. Now let's see how your game was rated by the press.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on 'Accept'</color>
If your game doesn't meet your expectations, don't be disappointed. For example, you can build a <b>Research</b> room and unlock new features for your games. Later you can also build advanced rooms like a <b>Graphics or Sound studio</b> to make your games even better.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on 'Accept'</color>
